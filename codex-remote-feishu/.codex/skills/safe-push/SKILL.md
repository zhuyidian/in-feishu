# safe-push

Use this skill when the task is to push already-committed local changes from this repository.

Prefer this command from the repo root:

```bash
./safe-push.sh
```

Before repeatedly checking whether the branch is publish-ready, prefer:

```bash
bash scripts/dev/worktree-facts.sh
```

Do not default to raw `git push origin <branch>` when this helper fits the task.

## Default behavior

The helper only automates the safe happy path:

1. require a clean worktree
2. `git fetch` the target branch
3. if the remote branch moved ahead, `git rebase` onto it
4. rerun `go test ./...` only when a rebase actually happened
5. if a rebase happened, require an explicit post-rebase review before push
6. if no drift is found, continue push; if drift is found, fix it first and then continue push

## Important limits

- It does not auto-resolve rebase conflicts.
- It does not auto-handle test failures.
- It does not auto-decide whether a rebase changed the intended direction or implementation.
- On conflict or test failure, it stops and leaves the repo state visible for manual handling.
- After a successful rebase, it requires a manual audit of:
  - whether the implementation direction still matches the intended plan
  - whether the implementation still matches the intended behavior after rebasing onto the latest branch state
- If drift is found, fix it first, then continue.
- In non-interactive shells, confirm the audit with:

```bash
./safe-push.sh --confirm-rebase-review
```

## Useful variants

- Push a non-default branch:

```bash
./safe-push.sh --branch feature-x
```

- Use a narrower post-rebase test command:

```bash
./safe-push.sh --test-cmd 'go test ./internal/adapter/feishu ./internal/core/orchestrator ./internal/app/daemon'
```

- Force tests even when no rebase happened:

```bash
./safe-push.sh --always-test
```

- Skip tests entirely:

```bash
./safe-push.sh --no-test
```
