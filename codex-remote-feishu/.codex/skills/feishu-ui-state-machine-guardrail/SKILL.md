description: Audit and update this repository's canonical Feishu card UI state machine after changing Feishu card state-machine logic carriers such as callback schema/parsing, card action routing, inline replace vs append-only decisions, lifecycle stamping, or old-card handling. Use after implementation stabilizes and before committing.

# Feishu UI State Machine Guardrail

Treat [docs/general/feishu-card-ui-state-machine.md](../../../docs/general/feishu-card-ui-state-machine.md) as the canonical reference for current Feishu card UI / callback-layer behavior.

Trigger this skill when the change touches Feishu card state-machine logic carriers, even if the intended UX behavior was "not supposed to change".

Typical triggers:

- callback payload schema or parsing logic
- card owner / kind / action routing logic
- inline replace vs append-only decision logic
- command menu / selection prompt / request prompt navigation logic
- lifecycle stamping, old-card reject, or callback freshness decision logic
- projector / gateway logic that determines whether an existing card can still act or what state mutation it performs

Do not trigger this skill for pure copy, styling, logging, tests, or refactors that leave those logic carriers unchanged.

Use this skill once per implementation pass, after the code and tests are mostly stable and before committing. Do not trigger it after every tiny edit.

## Workflow

1. Read the canonical document and the touched Feishu UI code paths.
2. Update the document so it matches the current implementation:
   - owner classification
   - callback `kind` and payload fields
   - form submit conventions
   - inline replace vs append-only boundary
   - `daemon_lifecycle_id` stamping and old-card semantics
   - current test baseline
3. Audit the changed behavior for Feishu UI dead-ends or stale-action leaks:
   - a same-context navigation action unexpectedly appends a new card instead of replacing
   - a state-changing action now replaces the current card and hides the real result
   - a stale card can still mutate product state
   - projector and gateway drift on payload keys or field names
   - lifecycle stamping is missing on cards that depend on current-daemon freshness
4. If the audit reveals a bug-grade issue, fix it before commit, add or update tests, then run this audit flow one more time.
5. If the remaining issue is a product tradeoff instead of a bug, append it under `## 待讨论取舍` in the canonical document.

## Update Rules

1. Keep “current implemented behavior” separate from “future controller / architecture ideas”.
2. When a change also affects attach/use/follow/new/request-gate product semantics, run the remote surface guardrail in the same pass.
3. Update `docs/README.md` when the canonical document path or classification changes.
4. Update `AGENTS.md` if the set of default trigger scenarios for this guardrail changes.

## Validation Floor

1. Run focused tests for the touched Feishu UI path:
   - `go test ./internal/adapter/feishu ./internal/app/daemon ./internal/core/control ./internal/core/orchestrator`
2. Do not commit if projector and gateway disagree on a callback payload that current cards can emit.
3. Do not commit if a stale card can still perform a product state mutation without an intentional, documented compatibility reason.
4. Do not commit if the new UI flow leaves the user with a clickable old card but no clear next action.

## Scope Reminder

This skill is the Feishu-card counterpart to the core remote surface guardrail. It covers Feishu UI session, payload, and freshness behavior, not the full attach/follow/queue product state graph by itself.
